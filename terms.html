    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <p>These terms and conditions apply to the <strong class="highlight">Houseplant Care+</strong> app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices, created by <strong>Август фон Медичи</strong> (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported service.</p>

    <p>By downloading or using the Application, you automatically agree to the following terms. We strongly advise that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Application.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. You are not permitted to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Attempt to extract the source code of the Application.</li>
        <li>Translate the Application into other languages or create derivative versions.</li>
        <li>Remove or alter any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.</p>

    <h2>Service Modifications and Charges</h2>
    <p>The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring the Application is as beneficial and efficient as possible. We reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for its services at any time. Any future charges for the Application or its services will be clearly communicated to you in advance.</p>

    <h2>Data and Security</h2>
    <p>The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your device. We strongly advise against <strong>jailbreaking or rooting</strong> your phone. Such actions could expose your device to malware, compromise security features, and cause the Application to malfunction.</p>
    
    <p>The Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms" target="_blank">AdMob</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/" target="_blank">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Connectivity and Usage</h2>
    <p>Some functions require an active internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data). The Service Provider is not responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to data or if you have exhausted your data allowance.</p>
    <p>If you use the Application outside of a Wi-Fi area, you accept responsibility for any charges from your mobile network provider, including roaming charges.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>While we strive to ensure the Application is updated and accurate, we rely on third parties to provide information. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying entirely on the functionality of the Application (e.g., missed plant care reminders due to device or software issues).</p>

    <h2>Termination and Updates</h2>
    <p>The Service Provider may update the Application at any time. You agree to always accept updates when offered. We also reserve the right to cease providing the Application or terminate its use at any time without prior notice. Upon termination, all rights and licenses granted to you will end, and you must cease using the Application.</p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may periodically update our Terms and Conditions. You are advised to review this page regularly for any changes. Continued use of the Application after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Effective as of:</strong> 2026-01-28</p>
