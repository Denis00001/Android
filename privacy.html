    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>Houseplant Care+</strong> app (hereby referred to as "Application") created by <strong>Август фон Медичи</strong> (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

        <li><strong>Device Info:</strong> IP address, operating system, and unique device identifiers for analytics and ad delivery.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third Party Access</h2>
